## Simple_Shell project

This project is a collaboration between Diego López and Jorge Zafra, actual students of Software Engineering at Holberton School. It consists of developing and making our own UNIX command interpreter (Shell).

The "Simple_shell" is a program that can be compiled and launched from the command line, where its main function is to execute commands read from the standard input. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the various shell programs like Kernel commands and builtin commands.

## Quick Start

1. Git clone this respository to your local directory.

       $ git clone https://github.com/diegolopezq95/simple_shell.git
  
2. Compile the program.

       $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
       
3. Now execute the shell.
      
       $ ./hsh
       
## Builtin Commands

This shell supports the next builtin commands:

    cd - change directory

    env - list the current environment variables

    exit - exit the shell
    
    help - show help for a builtin command
  
## Manual

To see the manual run:

    $ man ./man_1_simple_shell

## Examples
Some examples for builtins after execute ./hsh

cd:

	#cisfun$ pwd
	/home/vagrant/simple_shell
	#cisfun$ cd
	#cisfun$ pwd
	/home/vagrant
	#cisfun$
	
cd error:

	#cisfun$ cd hola
	./hsh: 1: cd: can't cd to hola
	#cisfun$

exit:

	#cisfun$ exit 123
	vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$ echo $?
	123
	
exit error:

	#cisfun$ exit hola
	./hsh: 2: exit: Illegal number: hola
	#cisfun$

help:

	#cisfun$ help exit
	exit: exit [n]
    	Exit the shell.

    	Exits the shell with a status of N.  If N is omitted, the exit status
    	is that of the last command executed.
	#cisfun$

help error:

	#cisfun$ help hola
	./hsh: 4: help: no help topics match 'hola'. Try 'help help' or 'man -k 'hola' or info 'hola'
	#cisfun$
