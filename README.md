## Simple_Shell

This project is a collaboration between Diego LÃ³pez and Jorge Zafra, actual students of Software Engineering at Holberton School. It consists of developing and making our own UNIX command interpreter (Shell).

The "Simple_shell" is a program that can be compiled and launched from the command line, where its main function is to execute commands read from the standard input. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the various shell programs like Kernel commands and builtin commands.

## Quick Start

1. Git clone this respository to your local directory.

       $ git clone https://github.com/diegolopezq95/simple_shell.git
  
2. Compile the program.

       $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
       
3. Now execute the shell.
      
       $ ./hsh
       
## Builtin Commands

This shell supports the next builtin commands:

    cd - change directory

    env - list the current environment variables

    exit - exit the shell
  
## Manual

To see the manual run:

    $ man ./man_1_simple_shell
