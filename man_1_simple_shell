.SH NAME
.B \fBSimple_Shell\fR - Command language interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB./hsh\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
Command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

.SH INVOCATION
An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments, just running \fB./hsh\fR. Otherwise, when is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, the shell reads and execute the next command \fBecho "pwd" | ./hsh\fR.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The first thing Simple_Shell does is to read the argument input form the user, after that the line read is split into tokens. Then, the Simple_Shell looks for the executable in paths specified by PATH environment variable. 

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
Each builtin command is executed directly in the shell
.TP
.B \fBenv\fR - Display all the enviroment variables.
.TP
.B \fBcd [dir]\fR - Change the current directory to dir. The variable HOME is the default dir.
.TP
.B \fBexit [status]\fR - Terminate the shell process with Ctrl+D (EOF) or with exit. Cause the shell to exit with a status of n.
.TP
.B \fBhelp [pattern]\fR - Display helpful information about builtin commands. If pattern is specified, help gives detailed help on all commands matching pattern.
.TP
.B \fBpwd\fR - Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables
.TP
.B \fBHOME\fR - The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the cd builtin command.
.TP
.B \fBPATH\fR - The search path for commands. It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
.TP
.B \fBPWD\fR - The absolute pathname for the current directory.
.TP
.B \fBOLDPWD\fR - The previous working directory as set by the cd command.
